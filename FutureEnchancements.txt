- Expand model to support several yarn's per recipe (colors or materials)
- Querying yarn and recipees based on name, brand, yarn etc.
- Subquery for recipe collecting the named yarn
- Subquery for recipe collecting a(or several) yarn alternatives based on gauge
- expand model to Amount of yarn if another yarn is used for the recipe
- More explicit connection between yarn used in recipe and yarn (foreign key)
- authentication for usage of service
- Ability to add other yarn types or recipees via mutations
    - Would be nice to have a openai integration which only needs a url to the recipe or yarn
    - OpenAi will translate the data on website into defined data structure
    - Will need some sanity checks for url

Programatically:
- Move repository code into own solution (so it can be replaced if needed at some point)
- Create test solution for integration testing and schema-testing


Issues:
- some yarn types (mohair) does not contain gauge/density (strikkefasthet)
